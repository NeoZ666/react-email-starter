# React Email Starter

A live preview right in your browser so you don't need to keep sending real emails during development.

## Getting Started

First, install the dependencies:

```sh
npm install
# or
yarn
```

Then, run the development server:

```sh
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
```

Open [localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

## Why You Can't Send Emails purely using React :

1. **Client-Side Execution:** 
   - React JS apps are run on the client-side (in a browser), meaning they have limited access to resources outside the browser environment.
   - Sending emails requires server-side capabilities, which cannot be directly accessed from the client-side.

2. **Need for SMTP Server:** 
   - Sending emails requires an SMTP (Simple Mail Transfer Protocol) server, which is typically set up on the server-side.
   - React-powered websites do not have direct access to an SMTP server from the client-side.

3. **Security Concerns:**
   - While in theory, you could provide SMTP credentials on the client-side, directly in the code, it's highly discouraged due to security risks.
   - Leaving sensitive data like SMTP credentials exposed in client-side code makes it vulnerable to theft or abuse.

4. **Role of 3rd-Party Plugins:**
   - To send emails from a React-powered website, you would need to integrate with 3rd-party services that provide email-sending capabilities via APIs.
   - These plugins or services act as intermediaries, allowing your frontend to communicate securely with their servers, which in turn handle the email sending process securely on the server-side.

In conclusion, while it's not possible to send emails directly from a React-powered website without 3rd-party plugins, integrating with reputable email service providers or plugins can provide the necessary functionality while maintaining security standards.
